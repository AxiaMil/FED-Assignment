                    <h1>Always Remind Yourself Why You Quit</h1>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            Every day, remind yourself why you quit. This will help you stay focused on the goals, and keep you motivated when you feel the urge to light up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Write down your reasons on sticky notes and paste them all over your house and office, on your mirror, fridge, wardrobe, laptop... items you see daily.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Slip a note into your wallet too, as a quick reminder whenever the urge to smoke rises and you reach for a pack of smokes at the convenience store counter.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On your quit journey, support from loved ones is important. Your family members and your friends are the people who’ll cheer you on, keep you motivated when you’re facing obstacles, and celebrate the small wins with you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Find someone who’ll quit smoking with you so you can motivate and support each other and celebrate the milestones. You can also join a smoking cessation programme or look for support groups to keep you company on your journey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Or have some non-smoker buddies help you along your journey: find an exercise kaki, a friend who’ll provide a listening ear and offer encouragement, and another friend who’ll be understanding and patient when you’re feeling cranky and moody. If you experience weight gain, get a friend who will be supportive and comforting.

                    <h1>Celebrate Small Successes</h1>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                        Reward yourself for the small wins (you deserve it!). Celebrate milestones like your first day without cigarettes, then your first week, then your first month...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Here are some ways to celebrate:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Get a massage</li>
                                <li>Catch a movie with friends</li>
                                <li>Enjoy a stacation using the money you saved</li>
                                <li>Share your good news and treat your family and friends to a good meal</li>
                                <li>Buy yourself a nice present</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <h1>Dump the Bad, Keep the Good</h1>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            Continue to avoid your smoking triggers: this gets easier with practice — soon, you won’t even need to make a conscious effort!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, keep staying away from smoking areas and events that might lead to smoking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Spend time in shopping centres, indoor eateries, and museums, where you wouldn’t be tempted to start smoking again. When heading outdoors, go to areas where smoking is prohibited, like reservoirs and neighbourhood town parks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And don’t forget to keep up the good habits like exercise, deep breathing, and snacking healthy. These not only help you stay smoke-free but also improve your overall wellbeing.
